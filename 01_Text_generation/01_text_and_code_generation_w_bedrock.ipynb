    "- **maxTokenCount** configures the max number of tokens to use in the generated response. (int)\n",
    "- **stopSequences** is used to make the model stop at a desired point, such as the end of a sentence or a list. The returned response will not contain the stop sequence.\n",
    "- **temperature** is a number in the range [0,1] that controls the creativity of the response. A temperature of 0 means the same prompt will generate completions with minimal variability (useful for reproducibility and debugging) while a temperature of 1 means the same prompt can generate differing and unlikely completions (useful for creativity)\n",
    "- **topP** is a number in the range [0.1,1] used to remove less probable tokens from the option pool, i.e., given a list of possible tokens in order of most probable to least probable, top p limits the length of the list to include just those tokens whose probabilities sum to at most top p. If top p is 1, the model considers all options. The closer top p gets to zero, the more the model focuses on the more probable options\n",

    "2. SQL query generation\n",

    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Entity extraction is an NLP technique that allows us to automatically extract specific data from naturally written text, such as news, emails, books, etc.\n",
    "That data can then later be saved to a database, used for lookup or any other type of processing.\n",

    "Classic entity extraction programs usually limit you to pre-defined classes, such as name, address, price, etc. or require you to provide many examples of types of entities you are interested in.\n",
    "By using a LLM for entity extraction, in most cases you are only required to specify what you need to extract in natural language. This gives you flexibility and accuracy in your queries, while saving time by removing the need for data labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, LLM entity extraction can be used to help you assemble a dataset to create a customised solution for your use case, such as [Amazon Comprehend custom entity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/custom-entity-recognition.html) recognition."
