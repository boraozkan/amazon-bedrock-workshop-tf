    "In this notebook, we will build a chatbot using the Foundation Models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock. For our use-case we use Claude V3 Sonnet as our foundation models.  For more details refer to [Documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/). The ideal balance between intelligence and speed—particularly for enterprise workloads. It excels at complex reasoning, nuanced content creation, scientific queries, math, and coding. Data teams can use Sonnet for RAG, as well as search and retrieval across vast amounts of information while sales teams can leverage Sonnet for product recommendations, forecasting, and targeted marketing.

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers.Chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. They can be accessed through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

    "## Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "![Amazon Bedrock - Conversational Interface](./images/chatbot_bedrock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chatbot (Basic)** - Zero Shot chatbot with a FM model\n",
    "2. **Chatbot using prompt** - template(Langchain) - Chatbot with some context provided in the prompt template\n",
    "3. **Chatbot with persona** - Chatbot with defined roles. i.e. Career Coach and Human interactions\n",
    "4. **Contextual-aware chatbot** - Passing in context through an external file by generating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Langchain framework for building Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "In Conversational interfaces such as chatbots, it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.\n",
    "It allows us to easily define and interact with different types of abstractions, which make it easy to build powerful chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Chatbot with Context - Key Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first process in a building a contextual-aware chatbot is to **generate embeddings** for the context. Typically, you will have an ingestion process which will run through your embedding model and generate the embeddings which will be stored in a sort of a vector store. In this example we are using Titan Embeddings model for this\n",
    "\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second process is the user request orchestration , interaction,  invoking and returing the results\n",

Overnight lows are typically in the 50s°F (10-15°C).\\n\\n- Winters are cool and wet. Average highs in December-February are in the mid 40s°F (7-9°C).

Seattle gets around 37 inches (940 mm) of rainfall annually, with November-January being the wettest months.\\n\\n- Spring and fall tend to be mild transition seasons, with a mix of rain and dry periods.\\n\\n- Seattle is also known for its frequent cloud cover and overcast conditions, especially during the rainy season from October to May.\\n\\nSo in summary, the weather is mild but wet and cloudy for much of the year, with a dry and slightly warmer summer season.
