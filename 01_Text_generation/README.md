# Lab 1 - Text Generation

## Overview

In this notebook, you will explore different capabilities of Amazon Bedrock and how to use foundation models for the following use cases:

1. **Text Summarization**: Create concise summaries from longer text passages
2. **Code Generation**: Generate Python and SQL code from natural language descriptions
3. **Entity Extraction**: Extract structured information from unstructured text

You'll see how to use the Boto3 SDK to interact with different foundation models available through Amazon Bedrock such as the Amazon Nova and Claude 3 Sonnet foundation models.

## Audience

Architects, data scientists, and developer who want to learn how to use Amazon Bedrock LLMs to generate text and code. 


## Workshop Notebooks

The above scenarios are covered in the following notebook. 
1. [Text Summarization, Code Generation and Entity Extraction](./01_text_and_code_generation_w_bedrock.ipynb) - Leverages the Amazon Nova and Claude 3 Sonnet foundation models.

## Setup
Before running any of the labs in this section ensure you've run the [Bedrock boto3 setup notebook](../00_Prerequisites/bedrock_basics.ipynb#Prerequisites).
