    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers.Chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. They can be accessed through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

    "## Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "![Amazon Bedrock - Conversational Interface](./images/chatbot_bedrock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chatbot (Basic)** - Zero Shot chatbot with a FM model\n",
    "2. **Chatbot using prompt** - template(Langchain) - Chatbot with some context provided in the prompt template\n",
    "3. **Chatbot with persona** - Chatbot with defined roles. i.e. Career Coach and Human interactions\n",
    "4. **Contextual-aware chatbot** - Passing in context through an external file by generating embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Langchain framework for building Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "In Conversational interfaces such as chatbots, it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.\n",
    "It allows us to easily define and interact with different types of abstractions, which make it easy to build powerful chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Chatbot with Context - Key Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first process in a building a contextual-aware chatbot is to **generate embeddings** for the context. Typically, you will have an ingestion process which will run through your embedding model and generate the embeddings which will be stored in a sort of a vector store. In this example we are using Titan Embeddings model for this\n",
    "\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second process is the user request orchestration , interaction,  invoking and returing the results\n",

      "Consider planting taller plants on the north side of the garden so they don't shade smaller plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Start seedlings indoors if you have a short growing season. Or buy starter plants to transplant\n",
      "once the weather warms up. Start seedlings 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Make sure to water, fertilize and weed your garden regularly. Most gardens need about an inch of\n",
      "water per week. Fertilize at the recommended rate to promote healthy growth. Weed weekly to avoid\n",
      "competition for your plants.\n",

      "• Provide a sturdy stake or cage for support as the tomato plant grows. Tomatoes need support for\n",
      "their heavy fruit and dense foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Water tomatoes regularly to keep the soil consistently moist. About 1 to 2 inches of water per\n",
      "week is a good target.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Fertilize tomato plants every few weeks. Use a balanced fertilizer with equal parts nitrogen,\n",
      "phosphorus, and potassium (such as 10-10-10). Follow the directions on the product packaging.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Prune tomato plants by pinching off side shoots for better growth. Allow the main stem to grow and\n",
      "prune off shoots that form between the main stem and branches.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Watch for common pests and diseases and treat them promptly. Things like aphids, hornworms,\n",
      "blight, and spot can damage tomato crops.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Harvest tomatoes once fully ripe on the vine. Look for deep red color and slightly soft fruit.\n",
      "Twist or cut them from the vine.\n",
      "\n",
      "• At the end of the season, pull up tomato plants once they are done producing to avoid\n",
